Some of our developers installed Ubuntu 10.04 and they are experiencing slow remote operation specifically git fetch, pull and push. I first suspected an error in the git server setup using indefero but the other users on Ubuntu 9.04 did not have this problem.

Investigating further, I found that using ssh to connect to the git server was also slow which could be the cause of the problem. To find out what happens during ssh connection I did:

ssh -v git@git-server

This revealed that ssh was spending a lot of time on using gssapi-with-mic.
To turn this off, I modified the file /etc/ssh/ssh_config to add

GSSAPIAuthentication no

Sure enough, the git operations improved and it has now stopped becoming a chore to do git fetch, pull and push.
