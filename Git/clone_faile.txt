While using git with https, sometimes, in someplace, I encounter like this error:

Initialized empty Git repository in /xxxx/xxxx/.git/
Password: 
error: server certificate verification failed. 
CAfile: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt 
CRLfile: none while accessing https://xxxx@xxxx.xxxx/xxxx/xxxx.git/info/refs

fatal: HTTP request failed

It might be a bug from Ubuntu¡¯s git, but I¡¯m not sure at this time.

For workaround of it, set GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1 in environment variables in the shell.

export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=1

Then it works!
